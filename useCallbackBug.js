This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that depends on a value from `useState` or another state management solution.  If the function within `useCallback` closes over the state variable directly, and the state variable updates, the memoized function will still retain the old value of the state variable, leading to unexpected behavior and stale closures. This can be particularly problematic in situations involving asynchronous operations or complex state updates.
